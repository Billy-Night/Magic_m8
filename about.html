                <p>Originally, the Magic 8-Ball is a plastic sphere, made to look like an oversized eight-ball, that is used for fortune-telling or seeking advice. It was invented in 1946 by Albert C. Carter and Abe Bookman. We proudly present you our futuristic version of the Magic 8-Ball. Ask a yes or no question to the ball, then simply click it to reveal an answer in a window on the ball.</p>
